Meteor 官网有[一个页面](https://www.meteor.com/about/project)专门表述自己的使命。我先写出我个人的理解和感受，再在下面附上原文。

帮助更多的人写出更好的软件。在上一篇文章中，我说 Meteor 是一种破坏性创新，指的就是通过创新方式，降低技术门槛，让原本需要较高脑力和熟悉度才能实现的事物能够被更多的人创造出来。编程是一项极为严谨的脑力工作，最初只有极少数人有能力胜任，那极少数人创造出软件帮助他们自己更轻松地写出软件，因为有了软件的辅助，开发者释放出一部分脑力，于是更多的人有能力胜任。如此良性循环，编程得以普及开来。我之所以看中 Meteor，正是因为它适用于那些不以编程为职业，且有其独特专业的人。__Meteor × 你的兴趣、专业、职业 = ？__ 你可以好好琢磨琢磨这一算式。

> Writing software is too hard and it takes too long. It's time for a new way to write software — especially application software, the user-facing software we use every day to talk to people and keep track of things.
>
> This new way should be radically simple. It should make it possible to build a prototype in a day or two, and a real production app in a few weeks. It should make everyday things easy, even when those everyday things involve hundreds of servers, millions of users, and integration with dozens of other systems. It should be built on collaboration, specialization, and division of labor, and it should be accessible to the maximum number of people.
>
> Today, there's a chance to create this new way — to build a new platform for cloud applications that will become as ubiquitous as previous platforms such as Unix, HTTP, and the relational database.
>
> It is not a small project. There are many big problems to tackle, such as: How do we transition the web from a "dumb terminal" model that is based on serving HTML, to a client/server model that is based on exchanging data? How do we design software to run in a radically distributed environment, where even everyday database apps are spread over multiple data centers and hundreds of intelligent client devices, and must integrate with other software at dozens of other organizations? How do we prepare for a world where most web APIs will be push-based (realtime), rather than polling-driven? In the face of escalating complexity, how can we simplify software engineering so that more people can do it? How will software developers collaborate and share components in this new world?
>
> Meteor is our audacious attempt to solve all of these big problems, at least for a certain large class of everyday applications. We think that success will come from hard work, respect for history and "classically beautiful" engineering patterns, and a philosophy of generally open and collaborative development.
